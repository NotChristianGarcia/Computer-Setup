## Automated Computer Setup
**Description:**  
This is my script to download, install, and initialize a new OS with wanted modules, shells, and packages.

**To-Do:**
- Split apart shell script for modularities sake.
- Allow compatibility with Windows (Though, eh.)
- export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin to .zshrc for access to pip installed stuff
